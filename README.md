# odin-recipes
A project to test my basic grasp of html.

I will be building a basic recipe page to practice basic html website structure. When I have completed this project, I will have demonstrated my ability to organize html files and images within a local directory, use tags and attributes to develop basic functionality, and use headers, links, lists, and other structures to build a basic layout.
